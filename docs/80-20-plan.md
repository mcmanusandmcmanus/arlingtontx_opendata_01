# 80/20 Delivery Plan – Public Safety App

## Goals
- Deliver actionable risk insights in days, not months.
- Minimize maintenance cost by leaning on serverless-friendly stack.
- Ship production-quality MVP with test coverage and deployment automation.

## Focused Scope (80 % Outcomes from 20 % Effort)
1. **Parcel Risk Leaderboard**
   - Weighted score = (cases × 2) + (code complaints × 1.5) + permit red-flags.
   - Data freshness: nightly ETL job; manual re-run command provided.
2. **Trend Intelligence**
   - 6-week rolling offenses + complaints lines to spot spikes.
   - KPI deltas versus prior period.
3. **Development Watchlist**
   - Permits > \$100K or pending > 30 days.
   - Exportable CSV for staff workflows.

## Deferred (After MVP)
- Predictive modeling (XGBoost, SHAP dashboards).
- Geospatial map layers + clustering.
- User authentication & role-based annotations.
- Automated data source syncing via Airflow/Temporal.

## Success Metrics
- <1 minute fresh ETL on sample datasets.
- P95 API latency < 200 ms on Render free tier.
- Lighthouse performance ≥ 85 for dashboard route.
- CI pipeline completes in < 5 minutes.
